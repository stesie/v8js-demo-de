V8Js Demo Slides
================

Slides (in German) of a presentation on V8Js I gave at
[Developer Camp 2016](https://developercamp.io/) in WÃ¼rzburg.

The presentation itself is made with Emacs' wonderful [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/),
exported to [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) using [org-reveal](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal).
